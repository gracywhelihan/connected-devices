Best Practices for Connected Devices:

- If all device manufactures used the same standards every device could talk to each other? Or do they already talk to each other even though they are using different standards?
- If there were universal standards would they be run by governments or the bigger tech companies? Or a commitee like IEEE? Do the big tech companies like Google and Apple have their own standards and other smaller companies use them?

I totally agree with the point made about having an on/off button. I always wondered why it seems like as technology progresses it is harder to turn things on and off. I remember my first cell phone and how I would just have to press the power button. Now I have to try to remember how to turn my iphone on and off by holding down a combnation of buttons and then confirming. I understand that for touch screen devices you wouldn't want to accidentally turn it off, so I guess the process makes sense. But also, becasuse there a lot of devices don't have clear on/off buttons or the process seems too long, all of my devices are on all the time. I think the only time I turn off my computer or ipad is when they need to be updated.

This also reminded me of another article we read either earlier this semester or in Understanding Networks, I can't remember and I can't remember what it was called. In that article it talks about how it is actually really dangerous to thow away your smart devices because they have a lot of info about you on them and are can be hacked once they are thrown away. I am not sure how acurate this is, but it is also something to think about with all devices. 

Who is Collecting Data From Your Car:

I think for me I kind of understand why it would be useful to have the location of a car as part of the data that is being collected on it, but I really don't understand why you would need to collect personal information like heart rate. I feel like this is where data collecting devices can go too far. Like there are other devices that can do that and are meant to do that. 
It is interesting to look at the 660 distinct data points used by OEMs.

## Environmental Systems Monitoring Device

So this week there wasn't a huge amount of process made. Priyanka and I mostly tried to brainstorm ideas on what environmental data we wanted to collect. We decided we were going to create a device using the temperature and humidity sensor. We got a protoboard and are soldering that together and plan to make a fun enclosure out of acrylic. The enclosure will need to be open though so that the reading remain accurate. 

[Here](https://priyanka-gracy-hot-or-not-list.glitch.me/) is our dashboard. There is still a lot of style and visualizing to do, but I was able to create a p5.js canvas that is also responsive :) I also realized that the reason why I was having trouble with adding p5.js into my dashboard was becasue I forgot to include the library.
