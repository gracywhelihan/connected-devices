# Final Project

There are sooo many APIs out there that would be very cool to use - it's a little overwhelming. 

My roomate did ask me last week if we could put a wind sensor on the roof and have it display how windy it is up. We live on the 2nd floor and our roof is on the 5th floor, so it is a little bit of a trek. And, of course, you wouldn't want to go up on a windy roof. So, I think that maybe I could use a wind API to display how show how windy it is on the roof. Ideally I would like to use a motor to simulate how fast the wind is actually moving. Kind of like a fan.

Bill of Materials:

Adruino
breadboard/wires
Stepper motor & motor driver
I am not sure what the enclosure will be yet.
