#Assignment 2

This week I continued to work on my device data dashboard. I am building off the MQTT Node.js Client HTML example on glitch that I remixed. I spend a lot of time this week working on trying to understand the code that was already there. Last week I just plugged in my broker info and was all set, but this week I wanted to try to understand each line of code. Also, I am pretty rusty and clueless when it comes to HTML and CSS, so I wanted to review some of that as well.
