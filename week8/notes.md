## Reviewing Sensor Data

- Some network routers don't let you connect
- pull command to maintain connection to the broker
- turn led off if you are not connected to the broker/network
- Arduino "freezing" --> we need an external way to "kick it" if it goes to sleep 
  - reset pin
  - how can we reset it and know when to reset it
  - build a small circuit where the arduino has to keep it high or low --> then it will trip the reset pin
