## Data Dashboard Update


## Reading

[The Slow Death of Surveillance Capitalism Has Begun](https://www.wired.com/story/meta-surveillance-capitalism/)
[A Skeptical Take on the A.I. Revolution](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/06/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-gary-marcus.html)

My take away from both readings is that there are going to be regulations that limit the way tech companies can collect data, which is good. That means that connected devices will also have regulations on what information they can collect and where they can send it. I think this also means that connected device need to be simple and secure. What I mean by this is, they should only be doing what they are made to do, and the company making it should be very transparent about it's funcitonality. Also, I think security is an obvious one, but the device should be secure. 

I do wonder with all of the A.I. and data regulations if people will feel inclined to stop using the voice controllers like Google Home and Alexa.

On the other hand, it is interesting because I feel that if the U.S. were actually going to ban TikTok people would be enraged. But TikTok does collect a lot of information about it's users. And I know it is quite entertaining and a lot of people make a lot of money from it, but also wonder if it were run by a company like Facebook if people would be more worried about their data being collected. Or maybe the users on TikTok really don't care about their data being collected?

The past few months I feel like so many people have been freaking out about A.I. but not for the reasons that were brought up in The Ezra Klein Show podcast. When I am talking about people I mean my friends and family outside of ITP. I found that everyone I talked to was very worked up about the fact that ChatGPT was so human-like and how scary that was. Which is pretty freaky but also makes sense because of the way it was trained, but I think this really does make people think that the model can critically think and know what is wrong or right. This is the scary part. There was that one article, [Bing's A.I. Chat: 'I Want to Be Alive'](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/16/technology/bing-chatbot-transcript.html), that had all of my coworkers in a frenzy! But in reality the A.I. doesn't know what it means when it is saying the stuff. And it is scary that it can produce false new and false info in such a human way, but just like the rest of the internet people should be aware of where they are getting their info.

Also, to bring data back into the conversation, don't the A.I. companies also need to collect data from their users to they can improve their model?
